== Acknowledgements

I would like to thank my team mates from Red Hat's System Design & Engineering group and the whole Atomic & OpenShift community for all their wisdom.

Special thanks for giving food for thoughts and reviewing:

* Aaron Weitekamp asking question I can think about
* Dirk Herrmann for being himself
* Rayford Johnson and Benjamin Kruell for their detailed reviews
* Scott Collier for keeping me laser sharp!
