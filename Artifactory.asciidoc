== Content Management: JFrog Artifactory

The Content Management (based on a software library) will hold any versioned
software artifacts (source or binary) that are relevant for production use.
The Content Governor will use different provided services to accomplish the
tasks of the content management domain. For the purpose of this Reference
Implementation we use JFrog Artifactory PRO (short: Artifactory).

Artifactory will not only be the central point of content ingestion, but will
also be used as a repository for intermediate binary artifacts, such as
container images or JAR files.


=== Artifactory Components

==== Artifactory PRO

The main component is Artifactory PRO, a Java based application. It may be
deployed on {OCP} or on a separate host as a standalone application. A base
configuration of the application is done via a ConfigMap ({OCP} case) or
classic configuration files (standalone case). Data is stored one volumes/disks
and a (persistent) PostgreSQL database. Customization, such as creation of
repositories required for ACME Corp IT-Dev operation, is done via an Ansible
playbook.

==== Storage and Database

Storage for artifacts and the PostgreSQL database is provided via NFS-backed
PersistentVolumes ({OCP}) or the local filesystems of the host running
Artifactory. The PostgreSQL database is used exclusively for Artifactory.
PersistentVolumes are provisioned from one (SPOF-FAIL, but {oos})
NFS server and are not backed up (FAIL-TODO, but {oos}).

==== Reverse Proxy

To implement https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/Docker+Registry#DockerRegistry-RegistriesandRepositories[Artifactory’s requirements on how to act as a docker registry] a
NGINX based reverse proxy is implemented. This will rewrite URL and pass them
on to the Artifactory PRO component.

All components can be deployed and undeployed from a single {OCP} template
via an Ansible playbook.

The following diagram will give an overview of the content management
architecture.

.Content Management Architecture Overview
image::images/cont-mgmt-architecture.png[Content Management Architecture Overview]


=== Interactions - User Stories

==== Administration by Content Governor (1)
The first interaction pattern implemented is related to content management,
including creation of local and remote repositories etc. A role call Content
Governor would either execute manual task via the Artifactory web user interface
or automated tasks via the REST API. Both interfaces offer the same functions.

==== Pulling Content for Builds (2)
The second interaction pattern is related to OCP Builds and ImageStreams. They
interface with Artifactory via HTTP/HTTPS to access Docker, Maven, NPM or Bower
repositories. In the case of Docker repository access a reverse proxy (3) is
used to translate docker registry interactions to Artifactory repository
interactions. This is required as Artifactory can host any number of Docker
registries, see the Artifactory documentation for details on Registries and
Repositories. All other repositories are accessed directly (4) without the need
of a reverse proxy.

Artifactory configuration and repository data is stored in a PostgreSQL database
and on a persistent storage volume, provided by a NFS server (5).

==== Proxying Content from remote Repositories (6)
All so called remote repositories implement a caching proxy for remote/upstream
repositories. Content within these repositories is cached for a certain amount
of time on storage. This is especially useful to speed up OCP Builds, as
required content must not be downloaded from the internet but from Artifactory’s
caching repository.


=== Implementation of Content Management

Two scenarios for implementation of the Content Management Services are feasible:

 * Artifactory and the reverse proxy via RPMs on a separate host
 * Artifactory and the reverse proxy as containerized components on {OCP}

==== Deploying Artifactory

ifndef::artifactory-on-openshift[]
WARNING: We aim to deploy all components on {OCP}, due to current limitations
of Artifactory only the reverse proxy is deployed to {OCP} but Artifactory itself
is running on a separate host.

To deploy Artifactory a RHEL7.3 host needs to be provisioned, including a
OpenJDK Java runtime environment.

.Artifactory Component Overview
image::images/content-management-implementation.png[Artifactory Component Overview]

Deploying and registering the host is {oos}, the following repositories must be enabled:

[format="csv",cols="2"]
[options="header"]
[frame="topbot",grid="none"]
|====
Repository ID, Repository Name
rhel-7-server-rpms, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Server (RPMs)
rhel-server-rhscl-7-rpms, Red Hat Software Collections RPMs for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Server
|====

===== Artifactory on a separate host

Installing Artifactory is described in detail at https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/Installing+Artifactory[Installing Artifactory]
and could be used as a reference. This section summarizes the commands used:
```
$ wget https://bintray.com/jfrog/artifactory-pro-rpms/rpm -O bintray-jfrog-artifactory-pro-rpms.repo
$ mv bintray-jfrog-artifactory-pro-rpms.repo /etc/yum.repos.d/
$ yum install -y jfrog-artifactory-pro
```

Using PostgreSQL or MySQL or the embedded Derby database and how to configure it
is {oos}.

How to configure the PostgreSQL database is also covered in detail by the Artifactory
documentation chapter https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/RTF/PostgreSQL[Configuring the Database].

Please check that the artifactory service is enabled (use `systemctl enable artifactory`)
and started. You should see an output similar to this:

ifdef::artifactory-on-openshift[]
This Chapter needs to be written...

===== Building the Artifactory container image

Please change to `container-image/artifactory` and have a look at the `Makefile`, change
`REPOSITORY_NAME` according to your needs.

A simple `make push` should do the rest.

```
cd container-image/artifactory
make push
```

Mind the Gap! There is a build id in the `Makefile` and the `artifactory.yaml` and in the `Dockerfile`

`make push` will build and push the Pro and OSS version of Artifactory.

===== Creating Artifactory template

An OpenShift template is provided and could be used to instanciate new Artifactory
applications. Therefore the template needs to be created on OpenShift: `oc create -f artifactory.yaml`.
This assumes that you have create a project on OpenShift, for detailed instruction
see Creating a Project[https://docs.openshift.org/latest/dev_guide/projects.html#create-a-project].

===== Creating Artifactory application

Deploying Artifactory on OpenShift is a simple step of instanciating a new
application on OpenShift. To provide default configurations to Artifactory,
a ConfigMap will be used, this is not created by the template. Please create
it beforehand.

If you want to use the Pro version of Artifactory, please provide a license key
via the config map, and overwrite the *ARTIFACTORY_IMAGE_NAME* of the template.

===== Artifactory default Config Map

To configure Artifactory a config map is created from the contents of `etc-opt-jfrog-artifactory-dist/`.
The following files must be present:
```
-rw-rw-r--. 1 user group  9858 Oct 22 19:58 artifactory.config.xml
-rw-rw-r--. 1 user group   856 Oct 24 16:14 artifactory.lic
-rw-rw-r--. 1 user group 11045 Oct 22 19:58 artifactory.system.properties
-rw-rw-r--. 1 user group   476 Oct 22 19:58 default
-rw-rw-r--. 1 user group  6858 Oct 22 19:58 logback.xml
-rw-rw-r--. 1 user group  5546 Oct 22 19:58 mimetypes.xml
```

Especially `artifactory.lic` is required if you run the Pro version.

The following commands will create the config map and instanciate the new Artifactory
application.

```
oc create configmap artifactory-default-config --from-file=etc-opt-jfrog-artifactory-dist/
oc new-app --template=acme-dev-infra/artifactory --param=ARTIFACTORY_IMAGE_NAME=artifactory-pro # or artifactory-oss
```

===== Initializing Artifactory

To get a quick start an Ansible playbook is provided to create a few repositories.
At least you need to customize the hostname of Artifactory, to see which hostname
is currently used, try `oc get route artifactory -o template --template={.spec.host}`.
This hostname should be set as variable `artifactory_host` in the playbook.

To execute the playbook run `cd playbooks && ansible-playbook create-default-repositories.yaml`. If the
repositories exists, failures will be shown, but ignored by the ansible execution.
Please make sure that any Docker type repositories have Token Authentication
enabled.

These steps are implemented and provided for your convenience as an <<playbooks/deploy-service.yaml#Ansible playbook,Ansible playbook>>.

===== Remove application from OCP

```
oc scale deploymentconfig artifactory-postgresql --replicas=0
oc delete service artifactory
oc delete service artifactory-postgresql
oc delete petset artifactory
oc delete deploymentconfig artifactory-postgresql
oc delete routes artifactory
oc delete pod --all
oc delete imagestream artifactory
oc delete configmap artifactory-default-config
oc delete template artifactory
```

Persistent Volumes are not deleted using these commands.
endif::artifactory-on-openshift[]

To configure a set of standard repositories used in the course of the {RefImpl},
an ansible playbook is provided at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/goern/artifactory-on-openshift/master/playbooks/create-default-repositories.yaml
It will create the following repositories:

.Artifactory default repositories
[format="csv",cols="4"]
[options="header"]
[frame="topbot",grid="none"]
|====
Key, Name, Type, Parent
testing-generic-local, , local generic, none
testing-docker-local, , local docker, none
redhat-ga-remote, Red Hat GA repository, remote maven, none
jboss-fuse-remote, JBoss Fuse repository, remote maven, none
repo1-maven-org-remote, Maven Central, remote maven, none
npm-org-remote, npmjs.org, remote npm, none
bower-github-remote, Bower, remote bower, none
docker-io-remote, Docker Hub, remote docker, docker-registry
access-redhat-com-remote, Red Hat Customer Portal, remote docker, docker-registry
docker-registry, ACME Docker Registry, virtual docker, none
|====

To run this ansible playbook, you need to set the environment variable `ARTIFACTORY_API_URL`,
it must point to Artifactory's API endpoint, in out {RefImpl} it is `http://acme-dev-infra-artifactory.acme.example.com/artifactory`

The resulting Artifactory repository structure should like similar to the
following screen shot.

image::images/acme-dev-infra-artifactory.acme.example.com-docker-registry.png[Artifactory Registry Overview]


=== Deploying a Reverse Proxy

ifdef::artifactory-on-openshift[]
ifdef::artifactory-rev-proxy-on-openshift[]
As part of the Artifactory OpenShift template a NGINX-based reverse proxy will be defined.
endif::artifactory-rev-proxy-on-openshift[]
endif::artifactory-on-openshift[]

ifndef::artifactory-on-openshift[]
ifdef::artifactory-rev-proxy-on-openshift[]
Even though Artifactory is deployed on a separate host, for this {RefImpl} the
reverse proxy will be deployed on {OCP}.

To deploy a NGINX-based reverse proxy on {OCP} three steps are required

1. get the NGINX configuration snippet from Artifactory
2. create a container image with NGINX and this configuration snippet
3. deploy an application based on the container image from step 2.

As a Source-to-Image build strategy will be used to create the deployable
container image, you need to initialize a new git repository and make it
available to your {OCP}.

Details how to create a S2I image can be found as part of the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/openshift-container-platform/3.3/paged/using-images/chapter-2-source-to-image-s2i[{OCP} documentation] and online at https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image[OpenShift's github repository].

TIP: You can find an example S2I NGINX repository at https://github.com/goern/s2i-nginx/tree/acme-it-dev

In summary, the NGINX Source-to-Image will copy and html, jpg, css (so called static files), a default NGINX configuration and all configuration snippets to a new container image. This new container image container a Red Hat Software Collections based installation of NGINX and a corresponding container entry point. If this image is deployed to {OCP} it will start NGINX on port 8080 and load all the configuration snippets and starts serving the static files.

We will use this pattern to configure NGINX to act as a reverse proxy for Artifactory.

So the next step will be, to configure the reverse proxy.

==== Obtaining NGINX configuration snippet from Artifactory

After you have created the S2I NGINX repository you need to add the Artifactory configuration snippet. Artifactory provides a restful API to do this, and the configuration snippet could be obtained very simple via `curl -gO http://artifactory.example.com:8081/api/system/configuration/reverseProxy/nginx`. Move this file into `etc/conf.d/artifactory.conf` of the S2I NGINX repository and add and commit it too.

The repository should look simular to this:

[source,bash]
----
$ ls -Rtln
.:
total 12
-rw-rw-r--. 1 1000 1000  321 Nov 22 09:59 nginx_rev_proxy.te # <1>
drwxrwxr-x. 2 1000 1000 4096 Nov 10 09:18 conf.d
drwxrwxr-x. 2 1000 1000 4096 Nov  7 13:15 html

./conf.d:

./html:
total 4
-rw-rw-r--. 1 1000 1000 150 Nov  7 13:16 index.html # <3>
----
<1> This file is provided for convenience, it is a SE Linux snippet used on a host based installation on NGINX
<2> This is the Artifactory configuration snippet retrieved from the restful API endpoint
<3> And this is a simple HTML not really needed to run the reverse proxy

TIP: Again, you can find an example repository at https://github.com/goern/artifactory-on-openshift/tree/master/container-image/reverse-proxy-nginx

==== Create NGINX container image using Source-to-Image

To create a container image out of the git repository assembled in the above step, you need to create a BuildConfig within {OCP} (and a corresponding ImageStream).

We provide `reverse-proxy.yaml` which is a complete declaration of all the {OCP} objects required to build and deploy a reverse proxy for Artifactory. It contains a few parameters, which are explained below. Details explanation of https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/openshift-container-platform/3.3/single/developer-guide/#defining-a-buildconfig[{OCP} BuildConfig] is available on the {OCP} documentation.

Lets have a look at the BuildConfig first.

.Reverse Proxy BuildConfig
[source,yaml]
----
include::reverse-proxy.yaml[tags=BuildConfig]
----
<1> Name of the BuildConfig
<2> The git repository holding the source
<3> and a reference (branch or tag) within the repository
<4> the directory within the repository holding the source
<5> a builder image, in our case the S2I NGINX container image
<6> the output ImageStream including the tag

As you can see, the resulting container image is pushed into an ImageStream, therefor this object needs to be created within {OCP}:

.Reverse Proxy ImageStream
[source,yaml]
----
include::reverse-proxy.yaml[tags=ImageStream]
----
<1> Name of the ImageStream, without a tag

==== Deploy the NGINX-based reverse proxy application

After a successful build, the ImageStream will have the newest container image containing the Artifactory configuration snippet. To deploy this container image three additional objects are required:

1. a Route, to direct traffic from an internet domain name to the service provided
2. a Service, to direct traffic from the internet to the pods
3. a DeploymentConfig, to declare how new Pods get created

All of these three objects are declared within `reverse-proxy.yaml`, detailes are described below.

.Reverse Proxy Route
[source,yaml]
----
include::reverse-proxy.yaml[tags=Route]
----
<1> The domain name at which provides the service
<2> the service name traffic gets directrd to

.Reverse Proxy Service
[source,yaml]
----
include::reverse-proxy.yaml[tags=Service]
----
<1> The name of the service
<2> and a set of labels used to select the pods implementing the service

.Reverse Proxy DeploymentConfig
[source,yaml]
----
include::reverse-proxy.yaml[tags=DeploymentConfig]
----
<1> Name of the container image created by the BuildConfig

==== Using Ansible to deploy the NGINX-based reverse proxy application

All these objects could be created from an {OCP} template, and this could be automated with an Ansible playbook. Such a playbook is provided as https://github.com/goern/artifactory-on-openshift/blob/master/playbooks/deploy-service.yaml[`playbooks/deploy-service.yaml`]. All the tasks have been tagged, so you can easily select either to deploy Artifactory itself, or just the NGINX-based reverse proxy.

To deploy only the reverse proxy make sure that the following environment variables are set:

.Ansible environment variables
[options="header"]
[frame="topbot",grid="none"]
|====
| Environment Variable | Comment
| OCP_URL | URL of the {OCP} master API endpoint
| OCP_USER | {OCP} username with role Platform Operator
| OCP_PASSWORD | Passoword of the user
|====

Use the Ansible playbook to deploy the NGINX-based reverse proxy for Artifactory by issuing the command

[source,bash]
----
$ ansible-playbook playbooks/deploy-service.yaml  --tags reverse-proxy
PLAY [Deploy Artifactory, see https://github.com/goern/artifactory-on-openshift] ***

 [... output delete ...]

PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************
localhost                  : ok=8    changed=6    unreachable=0    failed=0
----

Beside the fact that you may see a few warining or errors, none of the plays/tasks should fail. To validate that all objects required have been created you can use `oc get all --selector='application=s2i-nginx-acme'`.

endif::artifactory-on-openshift[]

ifndef::artifactory-rev-proxy-on-openshift[]
==== Reverse Proxy - NGINX

Installing NGINX from the Red Hat Software Collections is just a short command sequence:

[source, bash]
----
$ yum install rh-nginx18
$ scl enable rh-nginx18 bash
$ systemctl enable rh-nginx18-nginx
----

Next step is to get the reverse proxy configuration for NGINX from Artifactory’s REST API, and start NGINX:


[source, bash]
----
$ cd /etc/opt/rh/rh-nginx18/nginx/conf.d/
$ curl -gO http://artifactory.example.com:8081/api/system/configuration/reverseProxy/nginx
$ systemctl start rh-nginx18-nginx
----

To check that NGINX is working as expected you could use
`curl -Lv http://artifactory.example.com/`, you should see that you are
redirected, and at the end the artifactory web user interface is presented.
endif::artifactory-rev-proxy-on-openshift[]
